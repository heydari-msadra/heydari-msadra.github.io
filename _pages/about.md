I am a PhD student in Economics at the [Adam Smith Business School](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of **Professor Richard Dennis**. My research focuses on **Industry Dynamics** and the strategic interactions that shape market structure and innovation.  

Before starting my PhD, I completed an **MRes in Economics** (2023–2025) at the University of Glasgow. I hold a **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** with a **Minor in Economics** from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) (2018–2023). My academic background bridges computational methods and economic theory, which I apply to studying firm behaviour and dynamic markets.
