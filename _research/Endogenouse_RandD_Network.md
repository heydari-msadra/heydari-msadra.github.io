This project investigates the motivations behind private firms' decisions to publish their research findings, despite the competitive risks involved. Through a comprehensive literature review, four primary incentives are identified: attracting top-tier researchers, engaging in defensive publication to preempt competitors, leveraging publications as a strategic marketing tool in science-driven industries, and signaling research capabilities to potential partners.
Focusing on the signaling incentive, this study addresses a critical gap in the literature concerning research and development (R\&D) collaboration networks. To bridge this gap, a novel model of endogenous R\&D network formation is proposed, incorporating firms with varying productivity levels. Numerical simulations of the model reveal that the structure of R\&D networks is significantly influenced by the productivity gap among firms. Specifically, when the productivity gap is large, a _Positive Assortitive_ network structure emerges as stable, while a _Complete_ network structure becomes stable when the productivity gap is small. This study enhances our understanding of the strategic dynamics that influence R\&D collaborations and network formations in competitive environments.
